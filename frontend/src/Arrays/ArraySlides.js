    html: `<p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.</p>
        <p>If you have a list of items (a list of colors, for example), storing the colors in single variables could look like this:</p>
        <p>let color1 = "Red";<br/>
           let color2 = "Blue";<br/>
           let color3 = "Green";</p>

        <p>However, what if you want to go through the colors and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 colors, but 300!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>The solution is an array!</p>
        <p>An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to it by what number in line it is
        </p><br/>
        Check out this nifty little code editor down below. You can practice writing all the colors you can dream of in array form! <br/>Check it out. Once you're ready click next for the next lesson.

    <br/><p>It would be useless not to be able to change the structure of the array, either by adding elements or removing them.</p>
        <p>Certain array methods allow us to manipulate with array elements, so let‚Äôs talk about:</p>
        <h3>Push & Pop</h3>
        <p>Using .push lets you add a new element to the end of the array! Think of it like pushing someone into the back of a long line.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>const cookiesArray = [<br/>
          ‚Äúchocolate chip‚Äù,<br/> ‚Äúoreos‚Äù,<br/> ‚Äúsugar cookies‚Äù];</p>
        <p>=> chocolate chip, oreos, sugar cookies</p>
        <h4>And now we push!</h4>
        <p>cookiesArray.push ‚Äúsnickerdoodle‚Äù</p>
        <p> => chocolate chip, oreos, sugar cookies, snickerdoodle</p>

        <p>You are about to make your mom all these cookies üç™ and forgot she doesn‚Äôt like cinnamon! <br/> Now we definitely should take snickerdoodles out of the list!</p>

        <p>If you want to remove that unwanted last element from your wonderful cookies array üç™ , all you need to do is pop it right out of there!</p>

        <p>Using .pop lets you remove the last element of the array. Simple as that right? </p>

        <p>const  cookiesArray = [<br/>

        <h4> Unshift</h4>

        <p>If you need to add an element to the front of the array, you are talking about using unshift!</p>
        <p>Just remember, .pop makes you number 1.</p>

            <p>Got mom some milk ü•õ and flowers üå∑ so she can really enjoy her day?! You are so thoughtful. But wait..<br/>Maybe mom is too old for just milk and cookies, maybe you can throw some coffee ‚òïÔ∏è in there so she can have more choices? <br/>After all she is your favorite person right!</p>

            ‚Äúroses‚Äù] <br/>
            [ü•õ , üç´ ,üåπ]<br/><br/>

          superFunExtraStuffArray => milk, chocolates, roses<br/><br/>
            Now lets add that coffee to the front of the list like we talked about<br/>
            <br/>simply use Unshift at the end and you're sent to go!<br/><br/>
            superFunExtraStuffArray.unshift(‚Äúcoffee‚Äù)<br/><br/>
           => coffee, milk, chocolates, roses</p>
           <p>Okay time for a mini quiz, lets put our unshift knowledge to the test<br/>
           Remember our array with Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy? Well I think Pluto is missing!<br/>
